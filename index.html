there so many dog lovers out there&#63; Dogs share our lives in a way that most other animals can&#39;t&#44; and they&#39;re so commonplace that it&#39;s easy to take their faithful companionship for granted&#46; The purpose of this article is to remind us of why we love dogs so much&#44; to spare a few minutes and to spare a few words  "human&#39;s best friend" the dog&#46;

  	<div class="article"><span id="allart">Dogs are playful&#46; They love physical activity such as going for walks&#44; fetching sticks&#44; leaping into ponds&#44; and racing wildly to and fro&#46; Dogs will join you for a jog or for a day in the park or even for an exhuberant game of frisbee&#46; Yet dogs can also be soft and cuddly and ready at anytime for a loving pat and a reassuring hug&#46; They&#39;re affectionate and they&#39;re soothing to stroke&#44; plus most dogs can also remain calm when necessary and be tolerant of small children who don&#39;t yet know how to be quiet or to behave gently around animals&#46;
<br><br>
Dogs can be trained so that they can easily cohabitate with us in our human&#45;built dwellings&#46; They can also be trusted to act appropriately around other people and in public&#46; Dogs can learn to save nature&#39;s call for outdoor walks&#44; to walk on a leash when on public roads where cars lurk&#44; and to sit and to stay whenever and whereever necessary&#46;
<br><br>
The family dog is as much a part of daily life within a home as is any human household member&#46; Our dogs are always there for us&#44; day and night&#44; sharing in every activity from breakfast time through a cozy evening spent watching TV&#46; They can share both our indoor and many of our local outdoor activities&#44; but that&#39;s not all&#46; Dogs also play a big part in family life even when the family isn&#39;t at home&#46; They can readily go places with us in cars&#44; everywhere from a romp in the local park to a family vacation&#46; Because they can travel with us&#44; they can be a part of our lives in a way that most other companion animals can&#39;t&#46; As dogs can participate in many of our most unusual experiences and outdoor adventures&#44; they become forever associated with many of our most treasured memories&#46;
<br><br>
Dogs&#44; in all of their various shapes and sizes&#44; are also beautiful animals to admire and to look at&#46; From their big beautiful eyes and lovely faces&#44; to their soft&#44; sleek&#44; shiny coats&#44; to the tips of their joyfully wagging tails&#44; dogs are a pleasure to behold&#46; With so many different breeds to choose from&#44; everyone can choose the dog whose appearance most appeals to them&#44; whether large or small&#44; short or long&#45;muzzled&#44; short&#45;haired or long&#45;haired or curly or straight&#45;haired&#44; with a muscular build or a slim build&#44; with an elegant face or a comical face&#44; and in any number of colors&#46;
<br><br>
A safe environment is&#44; of course&#44; a must&#46; Indoors&#44; be sure that cleaning products&#44; medications&#44; houseplants and other potential poisons are kept safely out of reach&#46; Upper floor windows need secure grills or screens if they are to be opened&#46; Heavy objects must not be left where they might fall on and injure dogs&#46; Outdoor yards need secure fences if there are roads with cars nearby&#46; &#40;Please don&#39;t chain dogs outside and deny them their freedom of movement&#46;&#41; Antifreeze and other poisons mustn&#39;t be allowed to leak where any animals might have access to them and try to drink them&#46;
<br><br>
Above all else&#44; dogs deserve gentle handling and an abundance of our time and attention&#46; Love can make a dog&#39;s world go round as much as love makes our world go round&#46; When we give our love freely to our dogs&#44; we receive their love in return&#46; Dogs can truly be man&#39;s and woman&#39;s and children&#39;s best friends&#44; and we should feel honored to be theirs&#44; as well&#46;
